[0.00 - 0.46] SPEAKER 0: Please stand.
[0.46 - 0.48] SPEAKER 0: Judge Kors Also (tquecc) troublesome.
[0.48 - 1.32] SPEAKER 0: Judge, good afternoon.
[1.66 - 2.86] SPEAKER 1: Good afternoon, Senator.
[4.26 - 35.68] SPEAKER 0: Under article 3 of the Constitution, federal courts have jurisdiction over only cases and (contraversions,) ah, which means, under the Constitution, it has to be an actual dispute that federal courts cannot simply issue advisory opinions on on a question they may have a view on, and 1 component of article 3 jurisdiction is the requirement of standing, that in order for a plaintiff to have standing to bring a case, that that plaintiff, at least generally speaking, must have a real and concrete injury.
[35.82 - 36.78] SPEAKER 0: Is that right?
[37.38 - 38.28] SPEAKER 1: That is correct.
[40.08 - 54.90] SPEAKER 0: So for example, that means that even if I might have a disagreement with some particular policy or some particular law, that I can't bring a case unless I am personally aggrieved by that policy or that law.
[55.86 - 69.92] SPEAKER 0: So for example, your and my alma mater, Harvard, is currently being sued for its explicit and, in my view, egregious policy of discriminating against Asian-Americans.
[70.64 - 79.66] SPEAKER 0: Even though I think that policy is egregious, I, as an individual plaintiff, could not bring a lawsuit challenging it because I am not Asian-American.
[79.70 - 80.32] SPEAKER 0: Is that right?
[82.34 - 94.92] SPEAKER 1: If you brought a lawsuit, the court would have to evaluate whether you had an actual injury in order to be able to determine whether it had subject matter jurisdiction to hear the suit.
[95.26 - 99.58] SPEAKER 0: But if I'm not in the class being discriminated against, then I don't have the ability to bring the lawsuit.
[99.60 - 100.22] SPEAKER 0: Is that right?
[103.56 - 105.44] SPEAKER 1: You'd have to have an actual injury.
[105.88 - 110.62] SPEAKER 1: Certainly people, I think, who are in the class could claim that they had an injury for that purpose.
[112.10 - 116.18] SPEAKER 0: So now, you're on the board of overseers of Harvard.
[116.40 - 119.36] SPEAKER 0: If you're confirmed, do you intend to recuse from this lawsuit?
[120.16 - 122.00] SPEAKER 1: That is my plan, Senator.
[122.32 - 122.82] SPEAKER 0: OK.
[123.76 - 128.38] SPEAKER 0: We discussed yesterday how the standard for race discrimination was strict scrutiny.
[129.34 - 133.44] SPEAKER 0: The court has laid out a different standard for gender discrimination.
[134.46 - 138.06] SPEAKER 0: What is the constitutional standard that applies to gender discrimination?
[139.20 - 143.58] SPEAKER 1: Gender discrimination, the court has held.
[144.50 - 153.54] SPEAKER 1: Intermediate scrutiny applies, which is that the government has to have an important interest.
[154.78 - 158.14] SPEAKER 1: And the tailoring doesn't have to be as narrow.
[158.54 - 158.80] SPEAKER 0: Right.
[159.74 - 178.88] SPEAKER 0: So yesterday, under questioning from Senator Blackburn, you told her that you couldn't define what a woman is, that you were not a biologist, which I think you're the only Supreme Court nominee in history who's been unable to answer the question, what is a woman.
[179.90 - 196.88] SPEAKER 0: Let me ask you as a judge, how would you determine if a plaintiff had Article III standing to challenge a gender-based rule, regulation, policy without being able to determine what a woman was?
[197.84 - 200.14] SPEAKER 1: So Senator, I know that I'm a woman.
[200.36 - 203.44] SPEAKER 1: I know that Senator Blackburn is a woman.
[203.50 - 209.10] SPEAKER 1: And the woman who I admire most in the world is in the room today, my mother.
[209.82 - 212.78] SPEAKER 1: It sounded as though the question was.
[212.78 - 213.16] SPEAKER 1: But let me
[213.16 - 225.50] SPEAKER 0: ask, under the modern leftist sensibilities, if I decide right now that I'm a woman, then apparently I'm a woman.
[225.52 - 229.24] SPEAKER 0: Does that mean that I would have Article III standing to challenge a gender-based restriction?
[230.78 - 245.34] SPEAKER 1: Senator, to the extent that you are asking me about who has the ability to bring lawsuits based on gender, those kinds of issues are working their way through the courts, and I'm not able to comment on them.
[245.34 - 253.50] SPEAKER 0: OK, if I can change my gender, if I can be a woman, and then an hour later, if I decide I'm not a woman anymore, I guess I would lose Article III standing.
[254.60 - 258.66] SPEAKER 0: Tell me, does that same principle apply to other protected characteristics?
[258.74 - 260.80] SPEAKER 0: For example, I'm an Hispanic man.
[260.98 - 262.80] SPEAKER 0: Could I decide I was an Asian man?
[263.04 - 268.68] SPEAKER 0: Would I have the ability to be an Asian man and challenge (Harvard's) discrimination because I made that decision?
[270.36 - 272.52] SPEAKER 1: Senator, I'm not able to answer your question.
[272.52 - 276.82] SPEAKER 1: You're asking me about hypotheticals and these
[276.82 - 276.82] UNKNOWN: kinds of issues.
[276.98 - 278.08] SPEAKER 1: Well, I'm asking you how you would
[278.08 - 282.60] SPEAKER 0: assess standing if I came in and said, I have decided I identify as an Asian man.
[282.90 - 298.98] SPEAKER 1: I would assess standing the way I assess other legal issues, which is to listen to the arguments made by the parties, consider the relevant precedents and the constitutional principles involved, and make a determination.
[299.54 - 310.78] SPEAKER 0: Okay, let's go back to your favorite topic of this hearing, which is the criminal law cases you had as a district judge, and in particular, the cases involving child pornography.
[311.58 - 325.36] SPEAKER 0: Now, your defenders, both on the Democratic side of the dais and also in the press, have suggested that the criticism that has been raised has been somehow cherry-picked, that it's only some specific example.
[325.58 - 339.58] SPEAKER 0: So I'm going to give you an opportunity to discuss each and every case you've had, because looking at your cases, and I've now examined all of the child porn cases you've had as a federal district judge, there is a very consistent pattern.
[340.38 - 344.12] SPEAKER 0: So let's start, and by the way, I'm excluding the cases.
[344.68 - 352.86] SPEAKER 0: So Senator Durbin and Senator Coons focused on the Nickerson case, the Fife case, the Nguyen case, and the Hilly case.
[353.16 - 356.44] SPEAKER 0: I'm excluding those because those are not child porn cases.
[356.44 - 365.82] SPEAKER 0: Those are actual sexual assault of a child, which is markedly different, and I will concede when you're dealing with sexual assault, you have been willing to impose stricter penalties.
[365.86 - 375.94] SPEAKER 0: So let's focus on actual child pornography cases, and let's go through each of them, because if it's right that we're cherry-picking, then you should be able to explain quite powerfully.
[376.52 - 392.74] SPEAKER 0: Now, your justification is that you're following the statute, and as you know, 18 USC, Section 3553, lays out the factors that, as a district judge, you had to consider in sentencing, and let's start with the Hess case, United States versus Hess.
[393.68 - 402.88] SPEAKER 0: Now, in that case, a man sent six pictures of a prepubescent girl that he claimed was his daughter to an undercover law enforcement officer.
[404.08 - 413.82] SPEAKER 0: Officers found over 600 images of child pornography, including images of sexual acts being performed on prepubescent children.
[414.82 - 419.68] SPEAKER 0: The defendant pled guilty, and I believe in all of these cases, the defendant pled guilty, so there's no question about guilt.
[420.00 - 422.28] SPEAKER 0: They came in and pled guilty in your courtroom.
[423.88 - 430.52] SPEAKER 0: The charge carried a mandatory minimum sentence of five years and a mandatory maximum sentence of 20 years.
[431.28 - 436.48] SPEAKER 0: The sentencing guidelines recommended 151 to 188 months sentence.
[437.92 - 452.38] SPEAKER 0: The government, as part of a plea deal, agreed to argue for 60 months, but didn't agree that that would be the sentence, simply that they would advocate it, and you, in turn, sentenced Hess to 60 months.
[452.88 - 453.98] UNKNOWN: So, under
[453.98 - 461.88] SPEAKER 0: the terms of the statute, why did you choose to sentence Hess to the absolute lowest possible sentence you were allowed to sentence under law?
[464.24 - 465.48] SPEAKER 1: Thank you, Senator.
[465.68 - 471.14] SPEAKER 1: I have spoken at length throughout this hearing about these cases.
[471.56 - 478.04] SPEAKER 1: I've said what I'm going to say, which is I've taken every case seriously.
[478.16 - 485.44] SPEAKER 1: These are very horrible crimes, and I've taken every case seriously.
[485.54 - 486.82] SPEAKER 0: So you're not gonna answer that?
[487.78 - 514.78] SPEAKER 1: These are very horrible crimes, as was that one, and as a mother, having to look at these pictures, having to follow (Congress's) directive, having to listen to recommendations like the government in that case, which argued for 60 months, I imposed the sentence that I believed was the sentence that was required by law.
[514.80 - 523.62] SPEAKER 0: So I believe you, and I've actually, I've read your sentencing hearing in each one of these cases for which we have transcripts, and there are several of which we don't have transcripts.
[523.80 - 526.58] SPEAKER 0: So in each of these cases, you read from the same script.
[526.58 - 541.42] SPEAKER 0: So in each of these cases, you say that the distribution of child pornography is an extremely serious federal crime, and you point out that the crime involves people who are taking pictures and videos of real children while the children are being sexually abused.
[542.70 - 561.76] SPEAKER 0: In Hess, you pointed out that he had hundreds, hundreds of images of children in sexually compromised position, some of them engaged in sadomasochistic acts, all of this I'm reading from you on the bench, and most importantly, the children in these pictures are not knowing and willing participants in the degrading conduct that was being depicted.
[562.24 - 610.82] SPEAKER 0: They were being forced, forced by someone offscreen, to commit unspeakable acts of sexual violence for the pleasure of the people filming them and for the gratification of people everywhere, and what concerns me is that many of those people have absolutely no shred of empathy for what that conduct does for the children who were being abused in this way, and you read this script in every one of these cases, so you talk about that these are terrible, terrible crimes, but you also, and in Hess, you said, I have to say that what I found particularly disturbing about your offense was that, quote, you apparently concocted a story about having photographed your own daughter who you purportedly were willing to take pictures of to trade with other people.
[611.28 - 629.22] SPEAKER 0: I know from your comments and from those who know you that you are unlikely to ever harm a child, which I find remarkable that you've got a child predator in your court who says, I'm unlikely to harm a child, and you say, well, you told me that, so clearly you're unlikely, but you say, but in the context of the crime, you represented that you would.
[629.80 - 633.38] SPEAKER 0: That in and of itself is astonishing, so you talk about it as astonishing.
[634.52 - 646.64] SPEAKER 0: You nonetheless sentenced him to the very lowest possible sentence allowed under law, and what's striking is in these cases, in half of them in five, you sentence the defendant to the absolute lowest sentence under law.
[647.52 - 648.48] SPEAKER 0: Let's look at another case.
[648.54 - 650.84] SPEAKER 0: Let's look at United States versus Chazen.
[652.10 - 655.68] SPEAKER 0: Now, Chazen is a particularly nasty case.
[657.00 - 671.08] SPEAKER 0: In Chazen, the defendant was accused, accessed a drop box that contained 35 videos and 13 partially downloaded files of prepubescent minor females engaging in sexually explicit conduct.
[672.36 - 679.06] SPEAKER 0: At least three of the instances of prepubescent female children were engaged in sexual activity with adult men.
[681.50 - 692.94] SPEAKER 0: The images included the sexual abuse of children, including those as young as toddlers, and several of these cases that you had involved the sexual abuse of toddlers, which is truly horrifying.
[693.90 - 697.18] SPEAKER 0: In this instance, Chazen pleaded guilty.
[698.08 - 701.78] SPEAKER 0: The guidelines recommended a sentence of 78 to 97 months.
[702.86 - 710.78] SPEAKER 0: The prosecution argued that should be what the sentence was, and you sentenced Chazen to just 28 months.
[711.66 - 722.66] SPEAKER 0: Why did you sentence someone who had child pornography of toddlers being sexually abused to 28 months, 64 (%) below what the prosecutors asked for?
[726.74 - 727.36] SPEAKER 1: I don't know.
[727.36 - 727.96] SPEAKER 1: Thank you, Senator.
[731.40 - 735.76] SPEAKER 1: You've picked out, I don't know, seven, eight cases.
[735.86 - 737.96] SPEAKER 1: I've sentenced more than 100 people.
[738.18 - 739.32] SPEAKER 0: But not to child pornography.
[739.34 - 740.74] SPEAKER 0: And in every case, These are your child porn cases.
[740.90 - 741.84] SPEAKER 0: In every case,
[741.84 - 744.94] SPEAKER 1: Senator, I look at the evidence.
[745.24 - 754.58] SPEAKER 1: I look at the recommendations of not just the government, because my duty as a judge is to consider all of the arguments that are made in a case.
[755.16 - 756.40] SPEAKER 1: I look at the evidence.
[757.18 - 765.22] SPEAKER 1: I talk to the defendants about the harms that they have engaged in.
[765.74 - 768.64] SPEAKER 1: Many of these defendants are people who-
[768.64 - 770.88] SPEAKER 0: Okay, Judge, with respect, you're not answering my question.
[770.92 - 772.84] SPEAKER 0: You're right, you talk to them about the harms.
[772.94 - 775.30] SPEAKER 0: Let me read you again from what you said at the bench.
[776.10 - 778.96] SPEAKER 0: You said in this instance, with Mr.
[779.26 - 790.88] SPEAKER 0: Chazen, you said, among the defendants nationwide who received a below-guidelines sentence on the basis of a downward variance as opposed to a departure, the average sentences ranged from 84 to 92 months.
[790.90 - 792.76] SPEAKER 0: So that's what you lay out as the average.
[793.46 - 799.38] SPEAKER 0: Our Democratic colleagues say, well, other federal judges sentenced below the guidelines.
[799.42 - 801.78] SPEAKER 0: That is true, a number of federal judges do.
[802.86 - 818.70] SPEAKER 0: Our Democratic colleagues have not pointed to a single federal judge in the country who 100 (%) of the time sentences child-porned defendants to markedly below what the prosecution has recommended, unless you have a mandatory minimum and no ability to do so.
[819.12 - 824.80] SPEAKER 0: In this case, you say comparable defendants are sentenced to 84 to 92 months.
[826.10 - 835.06] SPEAKER 0: Sentencing guidelines by statute require you to have similarly situated defendants sentenced to similar sentences, but you don't sentence Chazen to 84 to 92 months.
[835.34 - 837.24] SPEAKER 0: You sentenced him to 28 months.
[837.58 - 837.88] SPEAKER 0: Why?
[837.88 - 841.72] SPEAKER 1: Senator, I've said what I'm going to say about these cases.
[841.80 - 846.34] SPEAKER 1: No one case can stand in for a (judge's) entire record.
[846.34 - 846.96] SPEAKER 1: Okay, but I'm
[846.96 - 847.96] SPEAKER 0: discussing every one of
[847.96 - 848.52] SPEAKER 1: your cases.
[848.80 - 850.72] SPEAKER 1: So if you're not gonna explain it, I'm
[850.72 - 850.72] SPEAKER 0: gonna...
[850.72 - 850.94] SPEAKER 0: Senator, would
[850.94 - 852.16] SPEAKER 2: you please let her respond?
[852.16 - 853.72] SPEAKER 0: No, not if she's not gonna answer my question.
[853.72 - 854.16] SPEAKER 0: Well, if you're just
[854.16 - 855.76] SPEAKER 2: going to give a speech, then
[855.76 - 856.62] SPEAKER 0: you shouldn't engage in questioning.
[856.64 - 858.28] SPEAKER 0: And you are not taking my time.
[858.32 - 861.40] SPEAKER 0: If you want to filibuster, you're welcome to do so, but do it on your own time.
[861.40 - 861.76] SPEAKER 0: I would at least
[861.76 - 865.20] SPEAKER 2: give you an opportunity to speak and you should give her an opportunity to respond.
[865.24 - 878.80] SPEAKER 0: If she wants to answer the question, I asked her why she sentenced Chazen to 28 months when comparable defendants, in her own words, were sentenced to substantially higher and she said she's not gonna answer.
[879.10 - 881.18] SPEAKER 0: I mean, I would welcome your answer, please.
[881.18 - 881.60] SPEAKER 0: Senator, I
[881.60 - 883.30] SPEAKER 1: didn't say I'm not going to answer.
[883.64 - 885.14] SPEAKER 1: I said my answer...
[885.14 - 888.62] SPEAKER 0: In this case, Chazen, why did you sentence him to just 28 months?
[888.68 - 889.42] SPEAKER 0: Senator, you're
[889.42 - 890.36] SPEAKER 1: looking at the record.
[890.48 - 892.10] SPEAKER 1: I don't have the record here.
[892.16 - 905.74] SPEAKER 1: What I will say is that in every case, I looked at the recommendations of not only the government, but also the probation office, the defendant, the record, the evidence.
[906.04 - 908.94] SPEAKER 1: I took into account the seriousness of the offense.
[909.66 - 917.30] SPEAKER 0: By the way, one of the striking things in Chazen, the prosecutor comes in front of you and says, this is the (prosecutor's) argument at this point.
[917.36 - 930.20] SPEAKER 0: And the prosecutor says, I understand from my experience before your honor, your (honor's) objection, policy objections, to the (2G2.2) sentencing guidelines.
[930.30 - 945.90] SPEAKER 0: And he goes on to say, however, in this case in particular, the four-point specific offense characteristic is justified because it contains sadomasochistic images of infants and toddlers.
[946.72 - 961.30] SPEAKER 0: I'm trying to understand how you see someone that possesses images of infants and toddlers being sexually violated, and you sentence them to 64 (%) below what the (prosecutor's) asking for.
[961.70 - 968.50] SPEAKER 0: You don't provide a justification other than a generic concern that the guidelines are too high.
[968.50 - 971.44] SPEAKER 0: You don't provide a justification as required by statute.
[972.46 - 990.96] SPEAKER 0: So I'm asking you to take the opportunity to explain to this committee and the American people why in 100 (%) of the cases, you have people with vile crimes, and you have language saying they're vile crimes, but then you sentence them to very, very low sentences.
[991.06 - 995.32] SPEAKER 0: And why do you consistently 100 (%) of the time choose to do that?
[996.78 - 1001.58] SPEAKER 1: Senator, no one case can stand in for a (judge's) entire sentencing record.
[1002.34 - 1004.42] SPEAKER 1: I've sentenced more than 100 people.
[1004.42 - 1008.30] SPEAKER 1: You have eight or nine cases in that chart.
[1008.30 - 1008.84] SPEAKER 1: Okay, Judge,
[1008.84 - 1009.82] SPEAKER 0: you said that before.
[1009.96 - 1011.74] SPEAKER 0: These are the eight or nine child porn cases.
[1011.86 - 1013.66] SPEAKER 0: I will say to correct the record I was talking about.
[1013.66 - 1014.18] SPEAKER 0: I'll just say to the Judge,
[1014.18 - 1015.54] SPEAKER 2: there's no point in responding.
[1015.58 - 1016.58] SPEAKER 2: He's going to interrupt you.
[1016.70 - 1022.68] SPEAKER 0: Look, I appreciate the Chairman trying to filibuster, and if you don't like your (witnesses') answers, you're welcome to provide your own.
[1023.88 - 1030.42] SPEAKER 0: She is declining to answer the question, and Chairman Durbin, if you want to join her on the bench, you can.
[1031.12 - 1035.42] SPEAKER 0: But Chairman Durbin, My job is to make sure Chairman Durbin, I'm not interrupting your questioning.
[1036.02 - 1037.78] SPEAKER 2: I'm asking you to give her a chance to answer.
[1037.94 - 1039.20] SPEAKER 2: But she has consistently said
[1039.20 - 1040.42] SPEAKER 0: she's not going to answer.
[1040.50 - 1044.90] SPEAKER 0: I want to clarify for the record, by the way, the case I was discussing was Cooper and not Chazen.
[1046.46 - 1047.26] SPEAKER 0: But Chazen
[1047.26 - 1050.96] UNKNOWN: is, the
[1050.96 - 1055.10] SPEAKER 0: case that I was reading from your transcript was Cooper, but Chazen, all right, let's get to Chazen.
[1055.22 - 1056.18] SPEAKER 0: I pulled the wrong tab.
[1057.38 - 1061.82] SPEAKER 0: Chazen is equally horrifying, and you say in Chazen, this is something Senator Graham asked you.
[1061.82 - 1069.80] SPEAKER 0: So the guidelines lay out different enhancements, and you say repeatedly, and this is true in all your cases, you say you disagree with the guidelines.
[1069.82 - 1070.64] SPEAKER 0: You think they're wrong.
[1071.22 - 1077.92] SPEAKER 0: And the two guidelines you disagree with is, one, there's an enhancement for use of a computer, and you say the world has changed, and now all of these are on a computer.
[1077.92 - 1078.62] SPEAKER 0: And I understand that.
[1078.62 - 1080.10] SPEAKER 0: I don't agree with you, but I understand that.
[1080.12 - 1082.46] SPEAKER 0: That is a understandable thing to say.
[1082.48 - 1089.06] SPEAKER 0: But the second thing you say over and over again is there's an enhancement for the number of images.
[1089.60 - 1104.34] SPEAKER 0: And you say repeatedly, for example, in Chazen, you say whatever the state of the law and technology at the time of the guidelines were first adapted, neither the use of the computer nor the number of images are especially aggravating factors today.
[1105.12 - 1108.48] SPEAKER 0: Now I find that bizarre, and you say it in every case.
[1108.48 - 1112.96] SPEAKER 0: You say the number of images, it's not an aggravating factor, it doesn't matter, and you won't apply the enhancement.
[1114.26 - 1131.22] SPEAKER 0: Do you really believe that a predator that has hundreds or thousands of images of hundreds or thousands of children being sexually violated has not committed an offense that is more serious than someone that has a single picture of a single child?
[1131.30 - 1138.58] SPEAKER 0: A single picture of a single child is horrifying, but hundreds of children that have been violated, do you really believe that is not a more serious offense?
[1140.14 - 1145.52] SPEAKER 1: Senator, I did not have any cases involving hundreds of thousands of pictures and-No, no, I said hundreds or
[1145.52 - 1145.90] SPEAKER 0: thousands.
[1145.90 - 1148.58] SPEAKER 0: You had cases involving hundreds and you had cases involving thousands.
[1148.58 - 1150.16] SPEAKER 0: You're right, you didn't have hundreds of thousands.
[1151.28 - 1157.26] SPEAKER 1: And I also applied an enhancement just not to the degree of the guidelines.
[1157.56 - 1158.14] SPEAKER 1: You're right, it's
[1158.14 - 1161.20] SPEAKER 0: a five-point enhancement under the guidelines, you provide two.
[1161.40 - 1164.88] SPEAKER 1: Yes, so not zero, not the suggestion that I did.
[1164.90 - 1167.16] SPEAKER 0: Are you suggesting the number of images doesn't matter?
[1167.20 - 1171.28] SPEAKER 0: Because you say it in court over and over again that the number of images doesn't reflect that it's a more serious crime.
[1171.38 - 1172.40] SPEAKER 0: Do you really believe that?
[1172.40 - 1192.92] SPEAKER 1: Senator, as I said to Senator Graham, the court is taking into account a number of circumstances the commission has done a report about the operation of the guidelines, which enhancements actually reflect different levels of culpability with respect-Let
[1192.92 - 1194.00] SPEAKER 0: me ask you this, Judge.
[1194.84 - 1204.92] SPEAKER 0: You said the purpose of sentencing is to distinguish and distinguish between crimes that are not as serious from truly egregious crimes, is that right?
[1205.22 - 1205.92] SPEAKER 1: No, Senator.
[1206.18 - 1211.82] SPEAKER 0: So what is the purpose of sentencing if it's not to distinguish from less serious crimes from truly egregious crimes?
[1212.02 - 1214.52] SPEAKER 1: It is to assign proportional punishment.
[1214.76 - 1225.80] SPEAKER 1: It is to do justice in cases where you have defendants who are convicted of the same conduct, but have different differing levels of culpability.
[1225.88 - 1231.18] SPEAKER 0: Well, I will point out that you have a pattern, and it doesn't matter how egregious the case is.
[1231.58 - 1242.58] SPEAKER 0: Senator Hawley talked about the Hawkins case where you had an 18-year-old with pictures of boys as young as eight being sexually assaulted and raped, and you sentenced him to just three months in jail.
[1243.20 - 1256.48] SPEAKER 0: And I will point out the Stewart case, the last one on this list, because we're running out of time, the Stewart case, you describe that he had over 6,700 images and videos.
[1256.48 - 1258.86] SPEAKER 0: So that's a lot, 6,700.
[1258.92 - 1261.82] SPEAKER 0: That's a lot of kids being sexually assaulted.
[1262.76 - 1264.52] SPEAKER 0: You have taken over a minute of my time, Mr.
[1264.54 - 1264.86] SPEAKER 0: Chairman.
[1265.10 - 1265.40] SPEAKER 0: I'll give you...
[1266.10 - 1267.70] SPEAKER 2: You've been given extra time.
[1267.78 - 1268.78] SPEAKER 2: You usually ask for it.
[1268.80 - 1269.36] SPEAKER 2: You're given it.
[1269.38 - 1270.80] SPEAKER 2: Okay, I
[1270.80 - 1272.12] SPEAKER 0: know you want to interrupt.
[1272.30 - 1272.98] SPEAKER 0: I know you don't like this line of questions.
[1272.98 - 1274.42] SPEAKER 0: I just want you to play by the rules.
[1274.62 - 1284.68] SPEAKER 0: I know you like to interrupt, but you've consumed a substantial time of my questioning, and I'm going to ask my questions, and if you want to testify, you're welcome to.
[1284.68 - 1287.44] SPEAKER 2: Senator, you play by the same rules as every other senator.
[1287.64 - 1303.36] SPEAKER 0: In the Stewart case, you said from the bench, thus, although this is not necessarily an atypical case, your child pornography possession crime was egregious in the (court's) view.
[1303.42 - 1304.68] SPEAKER 0: Okay, so this is a bad one.
[1304.76 - 1308.80] SPEAKER 0: If you're actually sentencing defendants, you said this was egregious.
[1309.28 - 1310.70] SPEAKER 0: What did you sentence Stewart for?
[1310.72 - 1313.06] SPEAKER 0: The guidelines said 9,721 months.
[1313.74 - 1315.12] SPEAKER 0: Prosecutors said 97 months.
[1315.22 - 1318.46] SPEAKER 0: You said it's egregious, 6,700 images.
[1319.16 - 1320.68] SPEAKER 0: You come in at 57 months.
[1320.68 - 1321.52] SPEAKER 0: Time has expired.
[1321.80 - 1323.56] SPEAKER 0: Senators, you're two minutes over than a lot of...
[1323.56 - 1325.32] SPEAKER 0: Why did you sentence him to just 57 months in the Stewart case?
[1325.40 - 1326.46] SPEAKER 0: Do you want to address that?
[1326.50 - 1327.78] SPEAKER 0: Because you're claiming it's cherry picking.
[1328.18 - 1331.62] SPEAKER 0: In fact, you're welcome to explain any of these cases, but let's take the Stewart case.
[1331.76 - 1332.76] SPEAKER 0: Senator Coons...
[1332.76 - 1334.50] SPEAKER 0: Why did you sentence him for half the amount?
[1334.60 - 1336.04] SPEAKER 2: You're not recognized, Senator.
[1336.04 - 1336.54] SPEAKER 2: Senator Coons...
[1336.54 - 1338.00] SPEAKER 0: You don't want her to answer that question?
[1338.44 - 1339.48] SPEAKER 0: You wouldn't allow her any...
[1339.48 - 1339.88] SPEAKER 0: Mr.
[1339.96 - 1341.38] SPEAKER 0: Chairman, she may answer the question.
[1341.38 - 1343.38] SPEAKER 0: I've asked her why she sentenced Stewart...
[1343.38 - 1344.50] SPEAKER 0: You're going over the time,
[1344.50 - 1345.52] SPEAKER 2: Senator, by two minutes and a half.
[1346.06 - 1346.88] SPEAKER 2: Because you've
[1346.88 - 1348.34] SPEAKER 0: interrupted me for two minutes, Mr.
[1348.34 - 1348.54] SPEAKER 0: Chairman.
[1348.62 - 1355.66] SPEAKER 0: Will you allow her to answer the question, or do you not want the American people to hear why with someone she described as an egregious...
[1355.66 - 1356.02] SPEAKER 0: There comes a
[1356.02 - 1357.40] SPEAKER 2: point, Senator, where you get a little bit...
[1357.40 - 1358.08] SPEAKER 2: Chairman Durbin,
[1358.08 - 1359.78] SPEAKER 0: will you allow her to answer the question?
[1359.80 - 1360.32] SPEAKER 0: You won't
[1360.32 - 1361.02] SPEAKER 2: allow her to answer the
[1361.02 - 1361.02] SPEAKER 0: question.
[1361.04 - 1362.96] SPEAKER 0: I will happily allow her to...
[1362.96 - 1370.50] SPEAKER 0: The question is why you sentenced Stewart, an egregious child pornography possessor, to half of the amount...
[1370.50 - 1371.10] SPEAKER 0: Please, Senator.
[1371.10 - 1372.16] SPEAKER 0: ...requested by the prosecutor.
[1372.30 - 1372.92] SPEAKER 0: Please, Senator.
[1373.52 - 1375.94] SPEAKER 0: Will you allow her to answer the question, Chairman Durbin?
[1376.18 - 1377.22] SPEAKER 2: Senator Coons...
[1377.22 - 1377.74] SPEAKER 2: Why are
[1377.74 - 1379.10] SPEAKER 0: you not allowing her to answer the question?
[1379.20 - 1380.76] SPEAKER 0: There's not another Senator here...
[1380.76 - 1380.80] SPEAKER 0: You're going over the time by two and a half.
[1380.80 - 1382.56] SPEAKER 0: ...that did not allow her to answer the question.
[1382.72 - 1382.96] SPEAKER 0: You're...
[1382.96 - 1386.44] SPEAKER 0: I'm not asking another question, but allow her to answer the question, Chairman Durbin.
[1386.90 - 1387.60] SPEAKER 0: Thank you, Chairman Durbin.
[1387.60 - 1392.08] SPEAKER 0: Why do you not want the American people to know what happened in the Stewart case, or any of these cases?
[1392.16 - 1397.78] SPEAKER 0: Chairman Durbin, I've never seen the chairman refuse to allow a witness to answer a question.
[1398.44 - 1399.92] SPEAKER 0: You can bang it as loud as you want.
[1399.92 - 1402.46] SPEAKER 2: I can just tell you, at some point, you have to follow the rules.
[1402.62 - 1404.20] SPEAKER 0: Okay, will you let her answer the question?
[1404.44 - 1408.18] SPEAKER 0: You've been interrupting, and by the way, with Senator Graham, it went 10 minutes over.
[1408.62 - 1410.38] SPEAKER 0: You've taken a big chunk of the time.
[1410.46 - 1412.76] SPEAKER 0: Will you allow her to answer the question?
[1413.28 - 1414.12] SPEAKER 2: You've given her...
[1414.12 - 1415.26] SPEAKER 2: Why are you afraid of her?
[1415.34 - 1416.78] SPEAKER 0: She's welcome to answer it right now.
[1416.80 - 1417.74] SPEAKER 0: Will you let her?
[1419.90 - 1420.56] SPEAKER 2: Senator Coons...
[1420.56 - 1422.82] SPEAKER 0: So, no, you don't want her to answer the question?
[1423.32 - 1423.98] SPEAKER 2: Senator Coons...
[1423.98 - 1425.36] SPEAKER 0: Will you let her answer the question?
