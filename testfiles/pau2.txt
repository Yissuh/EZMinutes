[1697.80 - 1754.16] SPEAKER 0: mga second tile, the third to end tile, ay mga pictures na. Then, 14 event highlights, hindi sa inyo yan. Ayan. So, yung mga during natin pub mats ay stations sneak peek, happening now. Winner announcement, stations are now open to all. Then, yung after ay event pictures. Ito hindi naman to sa inyo. And then, eto. So, bali, ang mangyayari, ang suggestion ko siya and Jessie is ang ano lang, kung baga (pasamasamahin) na natin, yung mga pwedeng same template. Pwedeng same na template.

[1754.16 - 1758.26] SPEAKER 1: 9,
[1758.26 - 1759.62] UNKNOWN: posting
[1759.62 - 1845.66] SPEAKER 0: 9, pub mat number 9, happening now, stations sneak peek, winner announcement, pata eto stations open to all, and then event pictures. Diba pansin nyo na parang parehas lang sila ng format. First tile, nakalagay lang yung title, tapos second to end tile ay mga pictures na, na kukunan during the event. Diba? So, pwedeng pare-parehas na lang ng template. Gawa na lang kayo ng isang first tile. Tapos ang mangyayari, iibahin na lang yung content na ilalagay para hindi na kayong mahirapan. Gawa na lang ng isang first tile na template. Tapos ang mangyayari, iibahin na lang yung content para hindi na madaming template ang gagawin nyo at iwas pagkakalayo layo sa team. So, same na lang siya lahat. Okay lang naman yun eh, kasi hindi naman na masyadong (makalata,) kasi ang focus naman nila is yung content, hindi naman yung design. As long as yung design is nakapasok doon sa team. Okay, bali gawa ang gagawin lang. Ito lang suggestions ko ha. Pero kayo pa rin (magbahala) sa designation. So, one.
[1848.22 - 1864.08] SPEAKER 1: (Salagay) ko na dito. One. And then two. (Ipipin) ko na lang yung mga sama-sama.
[1865.98 - 1866.96] UNKNOWN: Bali, atong
[1866.96 - 1872.26] SPEAKER 0: one solo yan gawa na ni Jesse. Yung two, i-designate nyo yan sa isang tao.

[3354.48 - 3358.52] SPEAKER 2: So that the designs are not different. Because in
[3358.52 - 3387.86] SPEAKER 0: the merch, the designs are different. So just put a stick on the pallet. Put a pallet that... Because they're not really followed. They're not really followed. Right?

[3493.24 - 3493.80] SPEAKER 5: Really?
[3494.52 - 3495.38] UNKNOWN: I think
[3495.38 - 3508.42] SPEAKER 0: he should. I think he should get a tutorial on how to get a premium. What is that? That's what it is. I don't know. If I get a student account, can I use it as a premium in Canva?
[3508.84 - 3525.20] SPEAKER 5: Yes, you can. You can get a premium account. That's your TMP account. That's what we did last year. At (Kalakoy) Cello. The design team. They just upload the fonts.

[3564.42 - 3564.92] UNKNOWN: Yes.
[3565.24 - 3570.64] SPEAKER 5: You can't. Because uploading is only visible to you.

[5445.88 - 5449.54] UNKNOWN: I'll be in the some break. Just a second.
[5479.54 - 5487.04] SPEAKER 0: I'm gonna do it. I'm not stupid. Yeah.
[5492.50 - 5494.46] UNKNOWN: There you
[5494.46 - 5500.84] SPEAKER 1: go. Jess, send it first. Wait a minute. I'm not stupid.
[5502.16 - 5517.68] SPEAKER 0: Jess, talk to us about the pallet, the inspo, and all the elements and all. So we can
[5517.68 - 5529.66] SPEAKER 1: get to know them better. Yeah. If you want it to be like that, just put the fire on
[5529.66 - 5529.66] UNKNOWN: top.
[5532.84 - 5559.96] SPEAKER 1: Wait a minute. How do you do that? Can you do it? It's like
[5559.96 - 5560.32] UNKNOWN: I'm
[5560.32 - 5590.02] SPEAKER 1: scarier when the fire is on top. It's like it's cleaner. That's it. That's it. How many do you want? The whole fire is on top of the fire. I want the whole thing to
[5590.02 - 5592.68] UNKNOWN: be cleaner. I also want
[5592.68 - 5594.04] SPEAKER 5: the whole thing to be cleaner.
[5596.38 - 5597.44] SPEAKER 0: That's right.
[5597.78 - 5600.78] UNKNOWN: Wait a
[5600.78 - 5604.12] SPEAKER 0: minute. Can you put the fire on
[5604.12 - 5611.24] SPEAKER 1: 24? What 24?
[5612.26 - 5620.90] SPEAKER 0: The one on 2024. Because there's a vacancy. What do you mean?
[5622.32 - 5623.76] SPEAKER 5: Put it straight first.
[5623.90 - 5627.56] SPEAKER 0: Don't cut it. It's mine.
[5629.32 - 5630.62] SPEAKER 2: On the side?
[5632.98 - 5637.22] SPEAKER 0: Yes. Is that the color of TG's pallet?
[5638.80 - 5649.74] SPEAKER 2: What's the color of TG's pallet? The color of TG's pallet is too bright. If you put it on top, it won't burn.
[5651.20 - 5663.22] SPEAKER 0: Just make the yellow color gold. The fire? Yes, gold. Kind of gold.
[5663.22 - 5665.60] UNKNOWN: It compliments
[5665.60 - 5675.80] SPEAKER 0: the gold color of TG's pallet. But it's good for me.
[5679.32 - 5681.00] SPEAKER 1: It's exciting.
[5682.32 - 5684.82] UNKNOWN: But TG's pallet. Okay.
[5685.86 - 5700.12] SPEAKER 0: Just talk to Jessie and all. You go first. We'll take care of X. You take care of that.
[5705.54 - 5707.16] UNKNOWN: How many
[5707.16 - 5708.58] SPEAKER 1: have you confirmed? What about us?
[5711.46 - 5727.20] SPEAKER 0: They're still asking. We haven't sent Moa yet. Four. Sponsored. I still don't want to go because I feel like they'll know if we say they won't go to (Ermot.)
[5730.60 - 5740.68] SPEAKER 1: What's the gender of the AI? I don't know. MJ, when will we do it in the stations?
[5742.00 - 5764.46] SPEAKER 0: When you finalize the sponsor. No, we'll do it. The sponsor can do it. What we need to do is the instruction of the challenge. Then the rules of the game. The violations.
[5768.72 - 5770.66] UNKNOWN: Then the
[5770.66 - 5807.44] SPEAKER 0: flow. I'm thinking about it. We have 10 stations. Then 10 teams. For example, team 1 is done with station 1. Then they go to the next station. Team 2 is not done with station 2. That's why we need rules. Is there a waiting area? Or what? When can
[5807.44 - 5807.52] SPEAKER 1: you do it?
[5812.76 - 5814.42] UNKNOWN: Can we
[5814.42 - 5816.10] SPEAKER 1: do it next Saturday?
[5817.44 - 5818.38] UNKNOWN: That's our support.
[5822.96 - 5824.12] SPEAKER 1: I'm the carry.
[5826.60 - 5826.64] UNKNOWN: Then last night.
[5828.38 - 5829.74] SPEAKER 1: Okay, go.
[5832.96 - 5833.94] UNKNOWN: Okay.
[5840.02 - 5841.44] SPEAKER 1: Okay, go.
[5842.70 - 5855.32] SPEAKER 0: Just designate sponsors and partners downstairs. Leave space. Then... I don't know when we can confirm it.
[5857.56 - 5863.24] SPEAKER 1: Our 16th main pub. What else? That's all.
[5866.06 - 5877.16] SPEAKER 0: Did I forget something? Okay. Jesse, just put it in the deadline. Two days before.
[5877.52 - 5878.66] SPEAKER 2: We should complete it tomorrow.
[5881.86 - 5890.74] SPEAKER 0: Yes. The fonts, the pallet, the elements, the tips. That's okay. There's no Canva. Canva is not premium. Right?
[5893.44 - 5897.60] SPEAKER 2: It's hard when you don't have Canva. That's why I moved.
[5898.26 - 5913.42] SPEAKER 0: It's okay. It's fixed. It's okay. Gideon doesn't use any text. Right? It's just a template. It's just an order. And the logo. I don't know.
[5916.82 - 5924.40] SPEAKER 1: Is that okay, Gideon? There. Let's eat.
[5925.52 - 5944.50] SPEAKER 0: Thank you. Where's Jen? Thank you, Jess. Jen said she's going to get a pen. Bye. Bye. Thank you, Chad. Thank you, MJ. Thank you, Jess. It's up to you.
